Section A - What is anarchism?

intro starts by introducing the problem of hierarchial authority as the root of the problems of modern capitalism and Anarchism as "a socio-economic and political theory, but not an ideology" the diffrence being the latter is a dogma set in stone, while the former is open to change as new data comes in and circumstances change. the FAQ emphasizes independent thought and that is not the final word on anarchism.

A.1.1 What does "anarchy" mean?

the word "anarchy" is Greek for "contrary to authority" or "the lack of a ruler". "No government" has always been a sloppy definition. anarchy is the absence of rule, not absence of order. anarchism is first and foremost anti hierarchy, and being anti-state is a consequense of that. anarchists seek to bring about "a decentralized society without coercive instutions organized through a federation of voluntary associations". older anarchist writings generally use the word "authroity" to mean the same thing. anarchists seek to create "order from the bottom up". more detailed dsucssion of anarchy is in section I.

A.1.2 What does "anarchism" mean?

Anarchism is the theoretical expression of out capacity to organise ourselves and run society wiithout bosses or politicians. anarchism is not absctract, but pratical.

A.1.3 Why is anarchism also called libertarian socialism?


The word anarchism highlights the negitive nature of anarchist theory, and terms like libertarian socialism, free socailism, free communism, and libertarian communism hightlight the postitive side of anarchist theory. these terms are used interchangably. a simple use of the dictionary definitions of "libertarian" and "socialism" shows this to be valid, despite dictiories being politically unsophisticated. the word libertarian does not imply free market capitalism, and socialism does not imply state ownership. due to the existance of the US Libertarian Party, confusion har arisen. anarchists have used the term libertarian since the 1850's and became more popular in the 1890's. anarchist organizations using the term libertarian have been founded as recently as the 1950's. the US libertarian party has approiated the term libertarian for themselves to describe their capitalist ideology. Section I describes how libertarian socailism maximises individual liberty better than capitalism, and section H details the failings of state socailism.
